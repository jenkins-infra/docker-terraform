= Docker Image for Terraform Operations

This repository hosts the resources to build a Docker Image used for Terraform operation on the Jenkins Infrastructure.

Its target is to provide a reproducible environment to not only run a controlled version of Terraform, but also to run infrastructure tests around terraform.
