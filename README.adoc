= Docker Image for Terraform Operations

[IMPORTANT]
Project superseeded by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-hashicorp-tools

This repository hosts the resources to build a Docker Image used for Terraform operation on the Jenkins Infrastructure.

Its target is to provide a reproducible environment to not only run a controlled version of Terraform, but also to run infrastructure tests around terraform.
